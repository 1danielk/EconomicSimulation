# EconomicSimulation
Several years ago I made [Economy analyzer for PDS's Vicoria 2 game](https://github.com/aekrylov/vic2_economy_analyzer) (currently updating by (https://github.com/aekrylov))

Making that tool made me dissapointed in how Victoria 2 economy made.

Since I didn't better game-like economy simulation,  I decided to try make my own.
So, main principles of that simulation:
* no ridiculus x5 price limits ( except obvious 0.001 and 999)
